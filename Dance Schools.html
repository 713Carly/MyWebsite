<h1> Dance Schools </h1> 
 
<p style="font-size: 30px"> There's loads of diffrent dance schools all over the world, but one of the most succesful schools is The Juilliard School in New York City. It is also one of the hardest dance schools to get into.
 The Juilliard only excepts 12 boys and 12 girls. 
First you must pass the ballet audition without being cut and get asked to do the modern portion of the exam. If not cut after that you will do a short solo.
 Then after the solo if you pass that as well you get into the school. </p>
